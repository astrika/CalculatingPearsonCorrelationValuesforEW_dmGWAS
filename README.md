# CalculatingPearsonCorrelationValuesforEW_dmGWAS
Dealing with duplicate gene probes from DNA microarray analysis and obtaining gene co-expression values by Pearson correlation.


Preparing for MS GWAS and GEO data analysis by EW_dmGWAS:

  i.	Loaded raw data from GEO108000 MS brain tissue data set, normalized the values, and matched gene symbols to Agilent DNA microarray probe IDs (from specified platform: GPL13497)

  ii.	Obtained the co-expression gene matrices for case/control phenotypes

  iii.	Reformatting the co-expression gene matrices for indicated EW_dmGWAS parameter
