# CalculatingPearsonCorrelationValuesforEW_dmGWAS
Dealing with duplicate gene probes from DNA microarray analysis and obtaining gene co-expression values by Pearson correlation.


#MS GWAS and GEO data analysis by EW_dmGWAS
i.	Prepared the GEO data from GEO108000
ii.	Loaded raw data from GEO108000 MS brain tissue data set, normalized the values, and matched gene symbols to Agilent DNA microarray probe IDs (from specified platform: GPL13497)
iii.	Obtained the co-expression gene matrices for case/control phenotypes
iv.	Reformatting the co-expression gene matrices for indicated EW_dmGWAS parameter
